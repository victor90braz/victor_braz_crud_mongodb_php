# CRUD using database MySql and PHP

- I started to learn MySql and PHP on 11-10-2022. My object is to build a CRUD application. I am still developing and new updates as a properly README and new features will come soon...

- First project with PHP and MySql.
  - Seeking to familiarize with the syntaxes and focusing on:
    - building the folders structures
    - and understanding the semantics.

## Commands:

- terminal cmd:

  - php -S localhost:3000

## Localhost

- interface graphic of mysql

  - localhost:80/phpmyadmin

- index

  - http://localhost/victor_braz_crud_mysql_php/index.php

## Connexion to database mysql

      $connexion_to_data_base = mysqli_connect("localhost", "root", "", "crud_mysql_php");




## Check the connexions to database mysql

- form action="/victor_braz_crud_mysql_php/src/components/post_form_task/saved_task_form.php"

  - http://localhost/victor_braz_crud_mysql_php/src/components/post_form_task/saved_task_form.php
